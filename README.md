✨ Shravani Meshram

Hi! I’m Shravani — a Computer Science student currently learning Python, SQL, C++, and Data Structures.
I’m building strong fundamentals so I can move into AI, Machine Learning, and Data-related roles.
I learn by doing, taking clear notes, and practicing consistently.

🌱 What I’m Learning Right Now :
-Python fundamentals (via BroCode + structured practice)
-Data Structures & Algorithms in C++
-SQL basics & query practice
-Git & GitHub version control

🎯 My Current Goals:
-Build clean foundational coding habits
-Create small beginner-friendly projects
-Improve problem solving through DSA
-Become internship-ready in AI/ML
-Keep my GitHub active and well-organized

📂 My Repositories:
python-basics → practice scripts, notes, exercises
cpp-dsa-practice → patterns, simple problems
sql-practice → queries + exercises
More coming soon as I learn!

🛠 Tech Skills (beginner-friendly):
Languages: Python, C++, SQL
Tools: VS Code, Git, GitHub
Learning: Pandas, NumPy, Machine Learning basics

🤝 What I Believe:
Consistency > perfection.
Small daily progress compounds.
I want my GitHub to reflect my learning journey — not perfection, but growth.
